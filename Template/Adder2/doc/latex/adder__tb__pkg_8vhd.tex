\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Testbench for a simple 1-\/bit adder \mbox{\hyperlink{classFullAdd}{Full\+Add}}. 

Testbench package for a simple 1-\/bit adder \mbox{\hyperlink{classFullAdd}{Full\+Add}}.

Uses a R\+AM for Input and another R\+AM for expected output. Implements Adder and compares output with Expected Output Ram. Since this design takes one full clock cycle to output the correct answer, an F\+SM was built to ensure stimulus signal would be stable long enough.
